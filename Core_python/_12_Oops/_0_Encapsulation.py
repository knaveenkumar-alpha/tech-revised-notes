Ex : class is an example for Encapsulation
     object is also an example Encapsulation
     
     
Abstraction :
--------------
Hiding the implementation details in the methods of a class from the real world.

In a "Normal class" Abstraction is 0%
In "Abstract Class" Abstraction is 0-100 %
In an "Interface"   Abstraction is 100%

Encapsulation :
--------------
Binding the data members(Fields,Variables,Attributes) & member methods(Methods(IM,CM,SM)) into single entity.

Class  ===> Logical  -- DATA    Physical -- METHODS
Object ===> Physical -- DATA    Logical  -- METHODS (Through method access)

Inheritance :
-------------
Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming

It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class.
The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class

Polymorphism :
-------------
    - Static Polymorphism -- Method overloading
    - Dynamic Polymorphism -- Method overriding
