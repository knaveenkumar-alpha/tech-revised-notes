Is Python Compiled or Interpreted
Compiled languages are written in a code that can be executed directly on a computers processor.
A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them
 into machine language or code that a computers processor uses. 2 4 6

Explain how python is interpreted
An interpreted language is any programming language that isn't already in "machine code" prior to runtime.
Unlike compiled languages , an interpreted language's translation doesn't happen beforehand.Translation occurs at the
 same time as the program is being executed. 56 67

Python as a programming language has no saying about if it's an compiled or interpreted programming language, only the
implementation of it.The terms interpreted or compiled is not a property of the language but a property of the
implementation.Python program runs directly from the source code.so,Python will fall under byte code interpreted.
The.py source code is first compiled to byte code as.pyc.This byte code can be interpreted (official CPython), or JIT
compiled (PyPy) Python source code (.py) can be compiled to different byte code also like IronPython (.Net) or Jython(JVM).
There are multiple implementations of Python language.The official one is a byte code interpreted one.
There are byte code JIT compiled implementations too.5 6

As concluding remarks, Python(Cpython) is neither a true compiled time nor pure interpreted language but it is called
interpreted language.
